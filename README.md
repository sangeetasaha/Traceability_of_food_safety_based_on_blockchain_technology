The implementation examines the potential of blockchain technology for assuring traceability and authenticity in the food supply chain, that consists of three units. The first being the aquaculture farms that tries to add their products to the blockchain by sending the details of their respective products along with the environmental conditions in their farms at the when the animal that has formed the product, was breeding. The second unit is formed by the enterprises that performs the mining operations and append new blocks to the existing blockchain, after validating if the above mentioned environmental conditions meet the optimal requirements as per the regulations laid by them, and the third unit is formed by the customers who purchases the products after they have reassured the quality. The farmsâ€™ environmental data are directly taken from the sensors present in the respective farms and the customers can verify the quality of the products before purchasing them. The concept of traceability lies in the fact that the farms can trace whether their products are a part of the blockchain and the customers can trace the quality of the product before purchasing them. As a result, transparency is provided, which would lead to a great deal of customer satisfaction with the purchase, and also there would exist a single storage system of the products.
